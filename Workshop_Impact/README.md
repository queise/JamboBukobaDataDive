#### Study of the impact of the workshops on the marks of schools

The analysis is explained in detail in the following ipython notebook:

[Workshop Impact](Workshop_Impact.ipynb)

Otherwise, look at least at the two slides summarizing the results:

[2 Slides](School_Performance_after_WS.ppt)

Anyway, our **conclusions** were:

1) Performance is better on the schools that participated in the workshops.

2) The performance of these schools continues to improve years after having the workshops.

[This plot](Regression_Performance_years_after_WS.pdf) summarizes our insights.
